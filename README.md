# ScatNet-QM-2D
Wavelet scattering regression of quantum chemical energies for planar molecules.

This software computes two-dimensional scattering transforms of planar molecules and corresponding molecular energy regressions, as described in the paper "Wavelet scattering regression of quantum chemical energies."
