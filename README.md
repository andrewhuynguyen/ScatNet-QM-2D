# ScatNet-QM-2D
Wavelet scattering regression of quantum chemical energies for planar molecules.

This software computes two-dimensional wavelet scattering transforms of planar molecules and corresponding molecular energy regressions, as described in the paper "Wavelet scattering regression of quantum chemical energies."

## Installation
The folder ScatNet-QM-2D can be saved to any location. In Matlab, add to the path the top level folder ScatNet-QM-2D and include all subfolders.
